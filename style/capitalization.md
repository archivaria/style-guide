# Capitalization
Many capitalization issues can be resolved quickly and easily by checking the *Canadian Oxford Dictionary*. It includes many personal, geographic, and organizational names. However, when it is not clear whether a personal or geographical name or title should be capitalized, refer to the *Chicago Manual of Style.* The general rules and some examples follow.

## People

**(a)** Capitalize civil, military, religious and professional titles and titles of nobility when they precede and form part of a personal name:

> Prime Minister Trudeau

> Finance Minister Bill Morneau

> Professor Nesmith

> Governor General Julie Payette

**(b)** Lowercase such titles when they follow a name, are used in place of a name, or are used in apposition before a name (i.e., “not alone and as part of the name but as an equivalent to it, usually preceded by *the* or by a modifier” [*CMOS* 8.21]):

> Bill Morneau, minister of finance

> the governor general

> the professor Tom Nesmith

> former prime minister Mulroney

**(c)** In biographical sketches of authors and promotional or ceremonial contexts (see *CMOS* 8.20), capitalize specific/special titles and those placed in apposition to a name, except those denoting a profession (think of the latter as a title that more than one person could have, which could be preceded by *an*):

> Leslie Weir is the Librarian and Archivist of Canada

> Wendy Duff, Dean, Faculty of Information

> Laura Millar, archival consultant

> > (as in, *an* archival consultant, not the only person with this professional title)

**(d)** Do not capitalize spelled-out titles in the plural or titles preceded by an indefinite article:

> The 10 provincial premiers attended the summit.

> A member of Parliament representing each of Canada’s major cities will be there.

> She is an assistant professor in the Faculty of Information.

**(e)** Do not capitalize a title modified by a possessive or other type of adjective, or by an indefinite article:

> They sent a petition to the Canadian prime minister.

> She made her decision known to her director.

> We raised our concerns with a member of Parliament from each province.

**(f)** Capitalize titles only when they refer to a specific person; do not capitalize a term that refers to a role rather than a person:

> The general editor of *Archivaria* makes the final article selection.

> Canada’s governor general lives at Rideau Hall.

> Instructions will come from the governor general’s office.

However, if using the title to stand in for the name of an individual, then rule (c) applies:

> On Wednesday, the Governor General will lay a wreath at the memorial.

> The chairperson addressed the shareholders with some bad news.

## Government Bodies
**(a)** Capitalize the full titles of international, national, provincial, state, regional, and local governments; the titles of government departments and agencies and their organizational subdivisions; the names of boards, committees, and royal commissions; and *the Crown* when it means the supreme governing authority:

> This brochure was published by the Government of Canada.

> The Department of Canadian Heritage is responsible for the program.

> The Archives of Ontario used to be part of the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Recreation.

**(b)** Short forms are normally written in lower case when used in a non-specific sense; when preceded by a possessive, demonstrative, or other type of adjective; and when used adjectivally or in an adjectival form:

> Our division met to discuss the matter.

> The New Brunswick government funded the program.

> Adherence to branch policy was cited as the reason.

> A committee was struck to investigate the matter.

**(c)** The word *government* is capitalized when it refers to the political apparatus of a party in power. It is lowercased when it refers in a general way to the offices and agencies that carry out the functions of governing:

> The Harris Government took Ontario to the right of the political spectrum.

> The Liberal Government balanced the budget for the first time in decades.

> The Archives of Manitoba is the official repository for historical records of the Manitoba government.

## Geographic Bodies
**(a)** Capitalize names of countries, regions, counties, cities, and other geographical entities; capitalize any geographical feature that appears on a map.

**(b)** Terms used generically are not capitalized.

> The Provincial Archives of Alberta is located in the city of Edmonton.

*But*

> As a municipal worker, he gets his paycheque from the City of Edmonton.

**(c)** For plurals, do not capitalize the generic term unless it comes first:

> Many canoes can be seen on Lakes Erie and Ontario during the summer.

> The Mackenzie and Fraser rivers both run through British Columbia.


## Question within a Sentence
When a direct question is introduced midsentence, capitalize the first word
of the question, whether it is introduced by a comma or a colon (see  *CMOS* 6.42).

> He posed this question to the study participants: Will the ...?

> She asked herself, What have I been doing all this time?
