# Spelling

The authoritative source for spelling is the *Canadian Oxford Dictionary*. When that source gives more than one variation (such as different British and American spellings), use *Canadian Oxford*’s preferred spelling, i.e., the one listed first.

*Archivaria* does not use contractions (i.e., uses *do not* or *was not*, NOT *don’t* or *wasn’t*) unless they are in a quotation or in a passage that clearly adopts a non-academic tone.
