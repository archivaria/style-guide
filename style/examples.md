## Archival Documents (Full Citation)
There is no absolute standard on citing archival documents nor is there consensus among the international archival community. The preferred practice for *Archivaria* is that footnote and endnote references move from the general to the specific. In other words, start with the repository, then cite the fonds and series title, reference codes (file, volume, box, etc.), and finally the specific item, title, date. The most important point about handling citations is to be consistent within your manuscript.

> <sup>52 </sup>Archives of Ontario, RG 47-27-1-71.1, Ontario historical studies series oral history program - political interviews, Interview with Robert F. Nixon, [sound recording], 1978.

> <sup>55 </sup>Archives of Ontario, Macaulay Family Fonds, F 32 (hereafter cited as Macaulay Papers), MS 78, reel 1, James Morrison to Robert Macaulay, June 16, 1788.

> <sup>56 </sup>Library and Archives Canada, Solicitor General, RG 73, vol. 145, file 1-21-20, “name of article/memo/etc.,” page number.

## Subsequent Citations
After the first full mention of a source in the footnotes, use a “shortened citation” as follows:

* On the second and subsequent references, use only the author’s surname followed by a comma and then the shortened article or book title (usually the main title up until the colon, omitting the subtitle unless it is needed to distinguish between two articles with the same main title). Follow this with a comma and the page or page range, if applicable.

* *Archivaria* does not use *ibid*. to refer to the previous citation. When referring to the last item cited, give the author name only, followed by the page number (even if this is the same page cited in the previous note).

* If there are two authors with the same surname, use the author’s full name to distinguish between the two.

### *First Time Cited*:

## Figures/Photographs
Captions appear below figures and photographs. The words *Figure* or *Table* and the number and the colon following are in boldface. The remainder of the caption is in sentence case and roman. If a figure needs to be credited, use *Source*:

> **Figure 1:** Screen shot of the searchable database. Source: …

## Tables/Charts
Tables/charts appear below captions; any notes (*nota*) appear below table/chart.

> **Table 1:** Title of table.

In text, refer to figures and tables using lower case according to *CMOS*, e.g., “See figure 3 on page 12.”

## Epigraphs/Opening Quotations and Abstracts

* Include a brief source note (i.e., author name and title of the work), preceded by an en-dash, on the line following an epigraph.

* If an epigraph requires a footnote (i.e., if the source is not well known), the reference number should follow this source note.

* Treat sources for all epigraphs in the same work consistently.

### *More on Epigraphs*
* Place any opening quotation after the abstracts and before the introduction.

* Justify the text.

* Do not use quotation marks.
