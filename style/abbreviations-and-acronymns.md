# Abbreviations and Acronyms
Use the *Canadian Oxford* *Dictionary *for appropriate spelling and punctuation for abbreviations and acronyms. Abbreviations and acronyms used in text are usually spelled out in the first instance unless they are better known as an abbreviation or acronym:

> DNA, DVD, IQ, p.m.

## *The* with Abbreviations/Acronyms
Generally, if *the* is part of the name, but not absorbed by the abbreviation, use *the* as if the abbreviation were spelled out:

> The NFL comprises 31 teams.

> NFL games rarely get postponed owing to inclement weather.

> Do you listen to the CBC?

> The archivists at LAC ...

In other words, use *the* unless the abbreviation is used as an adjective or unless the abbreviation spelled out would not take a definite article, e.g., Library and Archives Canada/LAC (not “the LAC”).

## Use of Caps and Periods
**(a)** Capitalize the first letter and use a period for abbreviations of titles:

> Dr., Lt.-Gov., Mr., Mrs., St., Ste.

*But*

> Ms

**(b)** Use periods for abbreviations and suspensions that include lower case letters, except those that have become bona fide words:

> a.k.a., a.m., Dept., e.g., Ltd., No., Ont., Sask., vol.

*But*

> laser, radar, scuba

**(c)** Do not use periods for acronyms or abbreviations and acronyms that appear in full caps:

> AD, BC, CBC, CD-ROM, DC, GATT, HIV, HTML, ISO, MLA, MP, MPP, NAFTA, NATO, NWT, RCMP, UEL, UK, US, USA

Use the same principle when forming abbreviations specific to the archival profession in Canada (for organizations, checking their website may help):

> BCA, BCAUL, CCA, LAC, *RAD*, UBC

**(d)** Use the correct abbreviation for corporate names.

Corporate websites are an easy way to check for information on the proper spelling of corporate names. Names of federal government departments and agencies, as well as their acronyms, can be found at https://www.canada.ca/en/government/dept.html. Note that *NA* is the correct abbreviation for National Archives of Canada (not *NAC*), although this has now been superseded by *LAC*, for Library and Archives of Canada.

**(e)** Do not use periods for abbreviations of university degrees:

> BA, MA, MAS, PhD (see *CMOS* 10.21)

> *Academic degrees*:

> > * He received his master’s degree/his MLS/a library science degree in 2004 (lower case for generic reference; note the *’s*)

> > * He completed a Master of Information Studies degree in 2004 (capitalize the full/official names of degrees in author biographies; note that the word *degree* is lower case and there is no *’s* on *Master*).

## Names with Initials
For names of people where initials are used, do not put spaces between initials:

> Pierre E. Trudeau

> J.K. Rowling

> J.F.K.

> W.L.M. King
