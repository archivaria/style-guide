# Source Citations 
## General Guidelines
Works cited in articles should be referenced in footnotes. *Archivaria* does not publish bibliographies or lists of works consulted. The following examples exhibit what is commonly known as the “humanities style.” Refer to the *Chicago Manual of Style*, 17th ed., or Kate L. Turabian, *A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations,* 9th ed., for many more examples of different types of works, including electronic resources.

The abbreviation for “editor” is *ed.* and “editors” is *eds.* when coming after the author at the beginning of the citation. However, when it means “edited by” it is always *ed.* (no *s*) according to *CMOS*, 17th ed. 14.104. For example,

> <sup>2 </sup>Nupur Chaudhuri, Sherry J. Katz, and Mary Elizabeth Perry, eds.,  *Contesting Archives: Finding Women in the Sources* (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2010), xiii.

*But*

> <sup>5 </sup>Terry Eastwood, “A Contested Realm: The Nature of Archives and the Orientation of Archival Science,” in *Currents of Archival Thinking*, ed. Terry Eastwood and Heather MacNeil (Santa Barbara, CA: Libraries Unlimited, 2010), 4–21.

In a footnote, there is no comma following an article that ends in a question mark (e.g., “Who Controls the Past?” *American Archivist*, etc.).

However, please note the use of the comma in this shortened citation with a page number (example from *CMOS* 14.96):

> <sup>9 </sup> Batson, “How Social Is the Animal?,” 337.

Note that in citations, the place of publication is abbreviated in postal format (e.g. MA, ON, BC, NY. However, in running text, postal abbreviations are not used; instead, on first reference spell out the name of a province (e.g., the archivists at Queen’s University, Kingston, Ontario, ...).

Give an access date for online-only resources only if no publication or revision date can be determined from the source, but do not include one for articles in print/online journals like  *Archivaria, American Archivist*, etc. If an online journal is offered via a paid service (e.g., Springer), there is no way to include a URL that all readers can access; instead, include a DOI, if there is one.

In footnotes, *American Archivist* appears without *the*). In text, it is “the *American Archivist*” (include *the* but set it in roman with a lower case *t*).

Following *CMOS*, *Archivaria* does not use vol., or p. and pp. in citations unless they are necessary for clarity or if they are placed in brackets in a long explanation in a footnote. (Please note, however, that in the headings of *Archivaria* book reviews, the total number of pages is shown like this: 152 pp.)
