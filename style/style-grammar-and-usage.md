# General Guidance on Style, Grammar, and Usage 

The purpose of *Archivaria* is to educate, explore, and stimulate through the communication of ideas and information to its readers. Clear and concise expression of ideas is a standard on which *Archivaria* assesses suitability for publication. Simple, clear, grammatically correct prose facilitates the communication of ideas. Indeed, the more complicated or abstract the ideas, the greater the requirement for clear, direct, and unpretentious writing. Acronyms should be used sparingly, technical terms defined in simple words, and jargon avoided whenever possible.

There are many good reference books on the rules of grammar. Authors can find a chapter on grammar in the *Chicago Manual of Style*. Strunk and White’s *Elements of Style* is also useful.

## *A* and *An* before Vowels and *H*

Use *a* rather than *an* before words that begin with vowels or *h* and have a consonant sound (*y*/*h*/*w* ), e.g., a eulogy, a historical, a historian, a hotel.

Use *an* only before words with a vowel sound, e.g., an LSAT exam, an MP, an hour ago, an honour, an heir, an archivist.

## Miscellaneous
Use *more than* instead of *over* (e.g., more than 100 pages)

> Neither John nor Linda’s efforts …

Avoid writing “This essay attempts to explore” or “This paper discusses.” Instead, use the word *article* because the work will be a published article.

Keep in mind the international readership. In the text, include place names on first reference to help readers situate institutions that might not be familiar outside Canada. For example, Simon Fraser University should, on first reference, be Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia. For universities that have a major city in the name, there is no need to add the province (follow the *CMOS* rules for which cities do not need to be followed by a province/territory/state). Therefore, write University of Toronto and University of London, but Western University, London, Ontario.

In text, on first reference, include the spelled-out provinces/territories/states after the names of cities (if relevant) and towns. (While *CMOS* prefers postal code abbreviations in text as well as in notes, *Archivaria* uses postal code abbreviations *only* in notes). Follow *CMOS* rules about which cities do not need to be followed by a province/state.

In footnotes, Canadian provinces/territories and American states are abbreviated using the two-letter postal abbreviations (e.g., ON, NS; MI, CA); see the lists of abbreviations in *CMOS*. Likewise, Australian states are abbreviated in footnotes (NSW).
